# Neverending
Neverending | 2D Top down, Twin Stick, Rogue-Like Shooter

I was the lead programmer for this project.

It contained
o Artificial intelligence behaviors for both enemy units and boss fights.
o State based animations and behaviors on the boss fight.
o Enemy unit pathfinding utilizing the A* algorithm and heap sorting for faster processing.
o A dynamic difficulty that would scale the difficulty based on the player's performance.
o Procedural dungeon generation.
o Virtual controls for mobile devices.
o Custom GUI
o SQLite database containing all of the game's data (enemies, boss, loot drops) to facilitate easy balance updates and loot generation.
o Maintained the project's version control and project management in Redmine during development.


This was my capstone project for my Master's Degree.
