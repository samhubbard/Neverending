# Neverending
Neverending | 2D Top down, Twin Stick, Rogue-Like Shooter

I was the lead programmer for this project.

It contained
Artificial intelligence behaviors for both enemy units and boss fights.
State based animations and behaviors on the boss fight.
Enemy unit pathfinding utilizing the A* algorithm and heap sorting for faster processing.
A dynamic difficulty that would scale the difficulty based on the player's performance.
Procedural dungeon generation.
Virtual controls for mobile devices.
Custom GUI
SQLite database containing all of the game's data (enemies, boss, loot drops) to facilitate easy balance updates and loot generation.
Maintained the project's version control and project management in Redmine during development.


This was my capstone project for my Master's Degree.
